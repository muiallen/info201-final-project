## Project Description
The dataset we will be working with is called Google Play Store Apps. The dataset includes 10,000 applications that are on the Google Play Store and detailed information about each application. The dataset is from kaggle.com and it has about 500 upvotes. According to kaggle, Lavanya Gupta, a software engineer at HSBC Software Development scraped the data for developer use in “analysing the Android market”. She found that many of the public datasets on kaggle were about the Apple App store so decided to collect Google Play Store data for the public and app-making businesses to use. 
The target audience of our project are mainly companies who are interested in deployimg advertisements on Google Apps. Our audience will be looking for the popularity and the category of apps for they want their advertisements to expose to their target audience and more people in general.

## Data Visualization
We will be displaying the data through a shiny app. Our shiny app is mainly consist of two graphs. The first graph is interactive, and it is presenting the percentage of each category based on number of apps.
