# Google Play Store Analysis - INFO201 Final Project
Zikai Song, Allen Mui, Heewon Song

## Dataset Description
The dataset we will be working with is about *Google Play Store* apps. The dataset includes 10,000 applications that are on the *Google Play Store* and detailed information about each application, including category, rating, number of reviews, number of downloads, and price. The [Google Play Store app dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps) is from *kaggle.com* and it has more than 600 upvotes. According to *kaggle*, Lavanya Gupta, a software engineer at HSBC Software Development scraped the data for developer use in "analysing the Android market". She found that many of the public datasets on *kaggle* were about the *Apple App Store* so she decided to collect *Google Play Store* data for the public and app-making businesses to use.

## Purpose
The target audience of our project are *mainly* **companies who are interested in deploying advertisements on Google Apps**. Our audience will be looking for the most popular apps and app categories they can target to advertise their related products on. By identifying areas of potential advertisement, the companies may choose to place their ads on those apps to **gain a larger exposure** among their target audience as well as people in general.

## Data Visualization
We will be displaying the data through a *Shiny* app. Our *Shiny* app mainly consists of two graphs. The first graph is **non-interactive**, and it is presenting a overall sight of the popularity of the Google Play Store apps in terms of category. The second graph is **interactive**, which gives advertising companies the freedom to examine data in a different range and scope. The interactive elements we include consist of pricing, category, and an index of either installs or reviews. The graph presents the **top 10 apps compared by the given price, category, and index** within the range. The audience can choose buttons and options to examine the range they are interested in detail. The *Shiny* app can be found [here](https://muiallen.shinyapps.io/info201-final-project/).

## Future Ideas
The dataset provide us with a detailed insight on user behavior on the *Google Play Store* platform. Based on the app data, we can go deeper and examine the relationship between different indexes, and research the factors that lead to the formation of certain correlations between indexes.The data enables us to portray an image of user and we can utilize it to provide better service to the users, developers, and advertising companies of the *Google Play Store*.
