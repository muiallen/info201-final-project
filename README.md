## Dataset Description
The dataset we will be working with is called Google Play Store Apps. The dataset includes 10,000 applications that are on the Google Play Store and detailed information about each application. The dataset is from kaggle.com and it has about 500 upvotes. According to kaggle, Lavanya Gupta, a software engineer at HSBC Software Development scraped the data for developer use in “analysing the Android market”. She found that many of the public datasets on kaggle were about the Apple App store so decided to collect Google Play Store data for the public and app-making businesses to use.<br/>Here is a link to the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps

## Purpose
The target audience of our project are mainly companies who are interested in deployimg advertisements on Google Apps. Our audience will be looking for the popularity and the category of apps for they want their advertisements to expose to their target audience and more people in general.

## Data Visualization
We will be displaying the data through a shiny app. Our shiny app is mainly consist of two graphs. The first graph is non-interactive, and it is presenting a overall sight of the data in terms of category. The second graph is interactive, which gives audience freedom to examine data in different range and scope. The interactive elements we are looking for is consist of pricing, category, and index, and the graph presents the top 10 apps compared by the given index within the range. The audience can choose buttons and options to examine the range they are interested in detail.

## Future Ideas
 The dataset provide us a detailed insight on user behavior on Google Play Store Platform. Based on the data, we can go deeper and examine the relationship between different indexes, and research the factors that lead to the formation of certain correlations between indexes.The data enable us to portray an image of user and we can utilize it to provide better service to the user and developer of the platform.
